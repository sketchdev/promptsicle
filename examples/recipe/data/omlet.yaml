  ### Steps

  1. Crack the eggs into a bowl, season with salt and pepper, and whisk until fully combined.
  2. Heat the skillet over medium heat and add butter or oil.
  3. If using fillings, sauté them first in the pan for a few minutes until soft, then set them aside.
  4. Pour the beaten eggs into the pan and swirl to coat the bottom evenly.
  5. As the eggs start to set, gently push the edges inward with a spatula while tilting the pan so uncooked egg fills the gaps.
  6. When the eggs are mostly set but still a little soft on top, add the fillings and cheese to one side.
  7. Fold the omelet in half with the spatula and cook for another 30-60 seconds.
  8. Slide it onto a plate and serve warm.
