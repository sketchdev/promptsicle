  Smash burgers are thin, crispy-edged patties cooked on a hot surface and literally smashed to maximize that savory crust. Theyâ€™re fast, flavorful, and hit that classic diner-style burger craving every time.

  * Mixing bowl
  * Knife and cutting board

  ### Ingredients

  * 1 lb ground beef (80/20 for best flavor)
  * Salt and pepper
  * 4 burger buns
  * 4 slices of cheese (American melts best)
  * Butter or oil for toasting buns
  * Toppings (optional): sliced pickles, onions, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard, mayo

  ### Steps

  1. Divide ground beef into 4 loosely packed balls, about 4 oz each. Don't overwork them.
  2. Preheat your skillet or griddle over medium-high heat until very hot.
  3. Lightly oil the surface if needed.
  4. Place a beef ball on the hot surface and immediately smash it flat using the spatula (use parchment paper if the beef sticks). Press hard to get it thin.
  5. Season the patty with salt and pepper.
  6. Cook for about 2 minutes until the edges are crispy and browned.
  7. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes. Add cheese right after flipping so it melts.
  8. While the patties cook, butter and toast the buns cut-side down on the skillet until golden.
  9. Assemble the burger: bun, patty, toppings, and the top bun. Serve hot.
