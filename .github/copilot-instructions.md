## Project Overview

We're building a library and command line tool to optimize prompts for development projects.
The library will provide a set of utilities to create, optimize, and evaluate prompts using various data loaders, optimizers, and scoring functions. 

## Technology Stack

- Deno

## Coding Guidelines

- **File Naming:** Use kebab-case for file names and folders. For example, `optimizer.ts`.
- **Utilities:** Place helper functions in the `lib/utils.ts` file.
- **Modular Code:** Focus on modular, readable, and testable code. Each file should have a single responsibility.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling where appropriate.

## Agent Mode Strategy

- **Template First:** Begin with stubs/templates that adhere to the structure above.
- **Clarifications:** If details aren't clear, generate placeholder comments noting where additional details are required.
- **Minimal Boilerplate:** Generate code that's production-ready while keeping boilerplate minimal.
- **Deployment:** Deno and library best practices should be followed for deployment.
- **Thinking:** Try to fix things at the cause, not the symptom. If you see a problem, address it in the code rather than just commenting on it.
- **Detail Orientation:** Be very detailed with summarization and do not miss out things that are important.

## Output Formatting

- Be succinct, following a casual yet professional tone.
- Keep inline commentary to a minimumâ€”document whole methods only.

Use these guidelines to ensure the generated code aligns with our project requirements.
